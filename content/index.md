# Welcome to Modern Classical Mechanics

Modern Classical Mechanics is an open, computational, project-based course in classical mechanics. Rather than starting from lectures and closed-form solutions, each unit pairs an activity notebook with formal notes so that students build equations of motion, simulate them numerically, and interpret the results themselves.

## What's in the book

The course runs 13 units, moving from foundations to the Lagrangian formulation:

- **Units 1–4** — what classical mechanics is, computing as a modeling tool, the Euler method, and building equations of motion (including fluid drag).
- **Units 5–6** — conservation of energy and momentum, stability, and equilibria.
- **Units 7–10** — phase space and critical points, oscillators, driven oscillations and resonance, and chaotic dynamics.
- **Units 11–13** — the calculus of variations, the principle of least action, and Lagrangian mechanics.

Each unit's **start** notebook is a hands-on activity — usually simulating a system in Python with `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `scipy.integrate` before working out the theory — and each **notes** notebook develops the formalism, worked examples, and derivations, with Taylor's *Classical Mechanics* and Strogatz's *Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos* as running references. Eight homework sets apply these tools to new problems. See the [Activities](activities.md) page for the full unit-by-unit list and [Resources](resources.md) for the texts and software behind it.

## How to Use This Site

* **Students:** Work through each unit's activity notebook before its notes, run the code yourself, and use the homework sets to practice. Everything is a Jupyter notebook, so you can also download it and run it locally.
* **Educators:** Reuse or remix any unit's notebooks for your own course; the source Markdown cells are the thing to edit, and `myst.yml` controls the table of contents.
* **Developers:** Help with the MyST build or site tooling — see [How to Contribute](#how-to-contribute) below.
